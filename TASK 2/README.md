# Unemployment rate Prediction in India

<br>

## Context
Unemployment is a critical issue in India, affecting millions of people and influencing the country's economic stability. Understanding the patterns and factors contributing to unemployment can help policymakers and businesses make informed decisions. In this project, we have collected data on various socio-economic factors such as education levels, age distribution, industry growth, and regional economic indicators to analyze and predict unemployment trends in India. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict unemployment rates across different regions and demographics, thereby providing valuable insights for targeted interventions.

## Project Objective
Utilize socio-economic data to develop a predictive model that can forecast unemployment rates in India. The project aims to identify key factors influencing unemployment and to create a model that can assist in understanding and mitigating unemployment challenges.
