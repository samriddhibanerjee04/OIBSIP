# Car Price Prediction

<br>

## Context
The automotive industry is vast and competitive, with car prices influenced by numerous factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, and additional features. Understanding how these factors impact car prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and dealers to make informed decisions. In this project, we have gathered data on various car attributes to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its specifications. The goal is to create a tool that helps users estimate car values, enhancing transparency in the car buying and selling process.

## Project Objective
Leverage car specifications and historical data to build a predictive model that can estimate the market price of a car. This project aims to provide a reliable method for assessing car values based on multiple features.

## Key Points
- The dataset includes variables such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine size, and additional features.
- The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts car prices accurately based on these attributes.
- The project helps in understanding the factors that most influence car pricing.
- The model can be used by car buyers, sellers, and dealerships to estimate fair market prices.
- This project is useful for those interested in applying machine learning in the automotive industry and for enhancing market transparency.
