# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
<br>

## Context
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: **setosa**, **versicolor**, and **virginica**. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

## Project Objective
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

## Key Points
- The dataset contains three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- Features used for classification include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of a flower based on these measurements.
- The dataset is a classic example for demonstrating the application of classification algorithms.
