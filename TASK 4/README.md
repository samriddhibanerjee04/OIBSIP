# Spam Email/Message Detection

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to detect spam emails or messages. The model is designed to identify whether an email or message is spam (unwanted or junk) or not (ham), using text classification techniques.

## Model Overview

The core of this project utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier, specifically the Multinomial Naive Bayes variant. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for text classification problems, where the features are based on word counts or term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores. After experimenting with various models, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was chosen for its superior precision, making it highly effective in identifying spam with minimal false positives.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** The raw email/message data undergoes a series of preprocessing steps, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF).
- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed to classify emails/messages. It models the likelihood of different words being present in spam vs. non-spam texts.
- **High Precision:** Precision was prioritized in this project to minimize the number of legitimate emails/messages incorrectly labeled as spam. This ensures that the model is highly reliable in real-world applications.

## Performance

- **Precision:** The model achieved the highest precision rate among the tested algorithms, making it a robust tool for spam detection.

## Usage

To use this model, simply input the text of an email or message, and the model will output whether it is classified as spam or not. The trained model can be easily integrated into larger systems for email filtering or message monitoring.
